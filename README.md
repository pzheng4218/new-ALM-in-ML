# new-ALM-in-ML
We develop a novel relaxed augmented Lagrangian method for solving a family of convex optimization problem subject to equality or inequality constraint. A large number of experiments on testing the linear support vector machine problem and the robust principal component analysis problem arising from machine learning indicate that the proposed algorithm performs much better than several state-of-the-art algorithms.
